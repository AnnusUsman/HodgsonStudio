    <p>HODGSON STUDIO had recently been one of 25 photography platforms who was chosen from a worldwide search for the most talented upcoming photographers. As one of the chosen photography platform, WE had the privilege of attending the prestigious Texas School of Photography in the USA where WE spent two unforgettable months studying with three of the most renowned photographers; Joe Buissink, Denis Reggie and Bry Cox. During this time, WE traveled to 17 states for an intense learning program taught by some of most respected photographers in the world. Being selected was an honor and a once in a lifetime experience which is presented to very few each year. HODGSON STUDIO was the first Pakistani to be chosen for the program.</p>
